### State Management

- **GetX Controllers** for reactive state management
- **Obx Widgets** for automatic UI updates
- **GetStorage** for local data persistence
- **Firebase Streams** for real-time data sync

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      match /homeworks/{homeworkId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading** of homework data
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **Connection Pooling** for Firebase operations
- **Error Retry Logic** with exponential backoff
- **Offline Caching** with automatic sync

## 🔨 Major Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Authentication Issues Fixed

1. **Navigation Loops** - Added navigation guards to prevent infinite redirects
2. **User Document Creation** - Ensured Firestore user documents are created on registration
3. **Session Management** - Implemented proper session reset functionality
4. **Login State Persistence** - Fixed authentication state not persisting across app restarts

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Text Visibility** - Fixed invisible text in input fields by adding explicit black color
2. **Responsive Design** - Added SingleChildScrollView and ConstrainedBox to prevent overflow
3. **Error Feedback** - Improved error messages and retry mechanisms
4. **Loading States** - Added proper loading indicators throughout the app

### Backend Improvements

1. **Network Error Handling** - Robust error handling for network connectivity issues
2. **Firestore Permissions** - Proper handling of permission denied errors
3. **Data Validation** - Client-side and server-side data validation
4. **Retry Logic** - Automatic retry for failed operations with exponential backoff
